	<h1>Classes in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>	As we've already mentioned, classes in JavaScript don't have to be declared with a special <span class="codeText">class</span> keyword.  Instead, a class is defined by the constructor for the objects that belong to the class.</p>
	<p>	A constructor has the format: 
	  <div class = "codeArea">
	  <pre>
	  var ClassName = function(value){
		this.member = value;
	    };
	  </pre>
	  </div>
	</p>
	<p>	The first thing to notice is the use of the <span class="codeText">this</span> keyword.  Just like in C++, the keyword <span class="codeText">this</span> means that the argument sent to the function <span class="codeText">value</span> will be assigned to the <span class="codeText">member</span> property of this object, namely, the object the function is being called on.</p>
	<p>	The constructor is automatically called whenever a new object of this class is created, on the object that is created.  To create the object we use the keyword <span class="codeText">new</span>.</p>
	<p>Here's the general syntax:
      <div class = "codeArea">
	  <pre>
	  var classObject1 = new ClassName("value1");
	  </pre>
	  </div>
	</p>
	<p>	This creates an object called <span class="codeText">classObject1</span> and, by means of the constructor above, assigns a value to <span class="codeText">classObject1.member</span>.
	</p>
	<p>	So far all of this is very general, though.  Let's look at a more specific example! </p>
