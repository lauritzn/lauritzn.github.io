    <h1>The Class-ic Detective</h1>
    <p> Imagine a murder mystery game in which the player gets to choose a detective.  To create the detective, the following class declaration can be used: </p>
    <div class = "codeArea">
    <pre>
    var Detective = function(name, sidekick){
      this.name = name;
      this.sidekick = sidekick;
      this.notebook = []; 
      this.notebook.push("It was a dark and stormy night.");
    }
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>A specific Detective object can then be created as follows:</p>
    <div class = "codeArea">
    <pre>
    var detective1 = new Detective("Sherlock Holmes", "Watson");
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>	This calls the constructor, which initializes <span class="codeText">detective1.name</span> to "Sherlock Holmes", <span class="codeText">detective1.sidekick</span> to "Watson", and adds one default note to an array that represents this detective's notebook. (Yes, it's the default, because what mystery story doesn't take place on a dark and stormy night?)</p>
    <p>So far so good.  Once those variables are initialized, though, we're probably going to want to do something with them.  That brings us to our next topic: member functions.</p>
