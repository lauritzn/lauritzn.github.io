    <h1> Guide to Emulating Classes in JavaScript</h1>
	<h2>Welcome!</h2>
	<p> Welcome to this how-to guide for emulating classes in JavaScript!  It will show you, step-by-step, how to produce classes in JavaScript that resemble the kind of classes you may already be familiar with from a language like C++.   A special technique in JavaScript, called closures, will let us do this.</p>
	<h2> Why This Guide? </h2>
	<p>Unlike some other object-oriented programming languages, such as C++, JavaScript does not have a special <span class = "codeText">class</span> keyword for declaring classes.  Along with this, it does not have special keywords for <span class = "codeText">public</span> and <span class = "codeText">private</span> data members and functions.</p>
	<p>This can make the transition to JavaScript tricky for someone who is used to programming in one of those other languages.</p>
    <h2> Documentation </h2> 	
	<p>Reliable information on this topic can be found on the Mozilla Developer Network:<br/><br/>
	  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures"> Documentation on Closures</a> (see the section "Emulating private members with closures")<br/><br/>
	  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Guides/Contributor_s_Guide/Private_Properties">Documentation on Private Members</a><br/><br/>
	  This guide expands on the resources above in a number of ways:
	  <ul>
	    <li>It offers a step-by-step approach designed to fill in any knowledge gaps</li>
	    <li>It provides original examples that build on one another progressively</li>
	    <li>It gives an extended discussion of the limitations of private members in JavaScript, backed up with examples</li>
	    <li>It aims to compare and contrast JavaScript and C++ explicitly</li>
	    <li>It finishes with a small, integrated program that lets you see how the pieces all fit together!</li>
	  </ul>
